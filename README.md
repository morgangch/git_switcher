# :flag_gb: git_switcher
Simple little program (maybe overcomplicated ig) that allows you to switch between 2 github accounts

## How can you setup it ?
How can you run this simple little script ?
You'll need to fill a file named ".switcher.env" with the following datas (replacing [] with the actual data) :
account1="[X]" // Name of the first github account
account1_mail="[X]" // Email for your second github account
account1_ssh="[X]" // Absolute path for the ssh key of this account

account2="[X]"
account2_mail="[X]"
account2_ssh="[X]"

## How can you run it ?
Simple as that, once the script is setup, the datas are given, you only need to run it this way :
[path_to_program].sh [account(1 or 2)]
And that's all.
